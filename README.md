     <b>Elementary Cellular Automaton Visualizer</b>
</p>

---

This project was developed for a 3rd-year biology course at the University of
Lethbridge to demonstrate the principle of 
[emergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence).

It allows for the visualization of elementary cellular automaton, using the 
rules defined by Stephen Wolfram in his book *A New Kind of
Science*. More information about elementary cellular automaton can be found [here](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html).

The website uses the static website generator [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
